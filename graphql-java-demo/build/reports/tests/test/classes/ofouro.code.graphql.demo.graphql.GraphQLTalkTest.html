This approach creates a tight and inflexible coupling between front- and back-end, and requires many client server interactions. This way of using an API on mobile devices, which are typically connected via unreliable, slow, and high latency networks, causes developers a lot of headaches. However, there is a new API kid on the block: GraphQL that solves this issues. GraphQL is a new way of specifying an API based on the demand of the API consumer.

The next step is building the cloud infrastructure to run the containers. In this talk I briefly touch upon building immutable software. But the main focus of the talk will be on creating an immutable infrastructure. In this talk I will show you how to create an immutable infrastructure on AWS with Terraform.

Despite this, software development teams are often more chaotic than they are self-organising, with the resulting code being more of a mess than was perhaps anticipated. Successful software projects aren’t just about good code though, and sometimes you need to step away from the IDE for a few moments to see the bigger picture. This session is about that bigger picture and is aimed at software developers who want to learn more about software architecture, technical leadership and the balance with agility.
